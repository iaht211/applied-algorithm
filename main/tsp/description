Description
There are n cities 1, 2, ..., n. The travel distance from city i to city j is c(i,j), for i,j = 1, 2, ..., n.  A person departs from city 1, visits each city 2, 3, ..., n exactly once and comes back to city 1. Find the itinerary for that person so that the total travel distance is minimal.
Input
Line 1: a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 20)
Linr i+1 (i = 1, . . ., n): contains the i
th
 row of the distance matrix x (elements are separated by a SPACE character)
Output
Write the total travel distance of the optimal itinerary found.
